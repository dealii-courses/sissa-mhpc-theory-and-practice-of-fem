# 1. Theory and Practice of Finite Element Methods

This is shared course between the SISSA PhD track
on Mathematical Analysis, Modeling, and Applications
(math.sissa.it) and the Master in High Performance Computing
(www.mhpc.it). It is a course that follows two parallel lines:
theory of finite element methods (graduate students level, ~20 hours) and
practice of finite element methods (mhpc students levels, ~20 hours).

The goal of the course is to provide to the students advanced
analysis tools for finite element methods, as well as 
state-of-the-art programming knowledge for the actual implementation part.

The theory ranges from basic FEM and functional analysis arguments, like
Lax-Milgram, Cea, and Bramble Hilbert lemmas, to more advanced topics,
like inf-sup conditions and a-posteriori error analysis.

The goal of the practice part is to enable a PhD or MHPC student working on
numerical analysis of PDEs to implement a state-of-the-art adaptive finite
element code, that runs in parallel, using modern C++ libraries. The 
implementation will be based on the `deal.II` library (www.dealii.org).

What you will learn:
- Advanced Finite Element theory
- How to use a modern C++ IDE, to build and debug your codes
- How to use a large FEM library to solve complex PDE problems
- How to properly document your code using Doxygen
- How to use a proper Git workflow to develop your applications
- How to leverage GitHub actions, google tests, and docker images to test and deploy your application
- How hybrid parallelisation (threads + MPI + GPU) works in real life FEM applications
